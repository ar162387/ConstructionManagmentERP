# Mock Data → Real MongoDB Migration

When implementing backend functionality for a feature:

1. **Remove mock data** for that feature once the real backend (MongoDB) is wired up.
2. **Use real MongoDB** as the data source — no mixing mock and real data for the same feature.
3. Update the relevant services, context, or data-fetching layer to call the backend API instead of returning mock/hardcoded data.

As you progress feature by feature, each completed backend integration should result in mock data being fully removed for that feature.
